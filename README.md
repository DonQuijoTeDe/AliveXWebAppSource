# Alive Web App

This is an **Alive web app** that transfered from the **Alive android app**

## Code Refactoring

I have been trying to **transfer** the original android app into web app

## Problems that need to be solved

1. Android activity life cycle
2. The flow of the alive app
3. Code organization
4. Sytax between android and js
5. Bluetooth

## Methods that I've thought and asked about

1. Use **React Native** to deal with the UI thread
2. Check whether the web have the **Corresponding API**
3. Be careful of the **Asynchronous Flow** with javascript

## The step that I've been doing (until 2016/3/22)

1. Use React Native to code with **EcgGridlines.js**
2. Doing the **MainActivity.js**
